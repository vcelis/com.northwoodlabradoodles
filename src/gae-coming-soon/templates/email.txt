Thank you for contacting us!

We currently do not have any litters at this time.

Our foundation breeding female, Fleur, will be going through her health testing (her OFA eye exam, OFA hips, and OFA elbows) in September of this year. If she passes all of her health screening she will be having her first litter in the Summer of 2019.

She is a medium-sized doodle with a rich, dark caramel coat that carries for parti and is currently working on getting her Canine Good Citizen certification.

We will include you in future updates such as health testing results, milestones, and eventual stud choice for her first litter.

We cannot wait to introduce your family to this wonderful breed of dog that has been apart of our household for the past six years. They are beautiful, well-mannered, intelligent, addictive, and unlike any other out there.

Warm Regards,

Vincent & Victoria Celis
Northwood Labradoodles
